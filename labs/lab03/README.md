Build a base employee class that includes the following properties and methods:

    - Employee number
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Department
* Methods
    - Print badge (outputs employee info captured above for print on a badge)

Build an hourly employee class which inherits from your employee class and that includes the following properties and methods:

* Properties
    - Hourly rate
* Methods
    - Process pay (hourly rate * 40 hours)

Build a salaried employee class which inherits from your employee class and that includes the following properties and methods:

Ensure you have tests in place to properly validate each. Feel free to work in a TDD manner (if desired).
