# Lab 06: DevSecOps

Using the sample GitLab pipeline configuration we've been walking through, add a GitLab workflow to the API you've been developing.

Add security (using plugin) to your IntelliJ IDE, add SAST to your GitLab pipeline, and add dependency analysis to your GitLab pipeline. You'll need access to the appropriate level of GitLab license to get access to some of the security features (e.g., security dashboard and security issue reports).
